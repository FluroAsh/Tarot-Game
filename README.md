## About the Project

This is my first little project as a part of my Codecademy syllabus. The program was designed to retrieve data from the rws tarot card api 
which is available at: (https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ekswagger/rws-tarot_card_api/1.0.0). Classes are utilised more so to make the code more reusable in the future 
should anyone wish to make further changes. 

Ultimately it's more of a narrative driven story telling experience, as opposed to just purely input, output -- with the goal to simulate more of an ominous 
atmosphere as opposed to feeling overly 'gamey'. 

There are definitely some improvements that can be made such as making the descriptions more readable in the terminal, as-well as simplifying some of the logic 
structures in the code to make it perform better. 

Future improvements may include utilising additional packages to incorporate features such as card images, and rich text to make the experience more engaging. 
It would also prove benefical to use a package such as matplotlib to arrange the output into a grid based format.
